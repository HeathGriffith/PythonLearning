# PythonLearning for AWS DevOps

## Introduction
This repository contains my practice code and projects based on the AWS workshop content available [here](https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/3d705026-9edc-40e8-b353-bdabb116c89c/en-US). The focus is on developing fundamental DevOps skills with Python that are important for using AWS technologies.

## Workshop Content
The AWS workshop includes modules on various AWS services and DevOps practices. This repository includes my practice and experimentation with the content that is introduced.

## Technologies and Tools
- Python 3.12.0
- AWS Services
- Boto3 (AWS SDK for Python)
